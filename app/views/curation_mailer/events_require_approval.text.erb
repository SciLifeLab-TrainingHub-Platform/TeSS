You are receiving this automated email because you are a curator of <%= @provider.title %> on <%= TeSS::Config.site['title_short'] %>.

  If any of these events are incorrect or should not be shown, please follow the link to change them.
  If an event should not be shown, disable it on the edit page instead of deleting it to prevent rescraping.
  If an event needs changes, lock the changed fields to prevent your changes from being overwritten by the scraper.
