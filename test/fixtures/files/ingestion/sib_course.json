Due to its popularity, R is continuously updated and extended with the latest libraries for data manipulation, modelling and visualisation. \n\nThis course will give an introduction to R and Rstudio (an integrated development environment for R) in an interactive manner. Participants will receive example data sets to practise data manipulation, graphical exploration and statistical hypothesis testing.\n\n# Audience\nThis \"First Steps with R\" two-day course is addressed to beginners wanting to become familiar with the R syntax, environment, and the most common commands to start using R to explore and interpret their data.\n\n# Learning objectives\nAt the end of the course, participants should be comfortable with the R environment and be able to read, understand and write R commands, allowing them to implement and interpret a workflow for their data analysis:\n* interact with the R environment\n* import data, explore it and summarise it\n* explore data with graphs\n* perform simple statistical tests\n\n\n# Prerequisites\n#### Knowledge / competencies\nAs it is a course for beginners, no background in R or any programming language is required. However, you are encouraged to go through some of the R documentation available [here](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html).\n\nPlease also note this course is NOT a training on statistics but rather a training on how to use R to perform different tasks, statistics being one of them.\n#### Technical\nA Wi-Fi enabled laptop with latest [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) versions installed.
